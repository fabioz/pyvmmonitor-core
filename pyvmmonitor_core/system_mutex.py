'''
To use, create a SystemMutex, check if it was acquired (get_mutex_aquired()) and if acquired the
mutex is kept until the instance is collected or release_mutex is called.

I.e.:

mutex = SystemMutex('my_unique_name')
if mutex.get_mutex_aquired():
    print('acquired')
else:
    print('not acquired')
